## Background

This lesson will focus on the correlation between offensive rating and height. We will be begin by exploring the data and conducting some descriptive analysis and visualizations. Then we will answer our question using a linear regression.

And in this process we will use linear regression which compares two variables and checks to see if there is a correlation between the two.

### Basketball Basic

If you aren't familiar with Basketball, consider watching this \[This is an introduction video\]

In a typical NCAA basketball game there are two teams of 5 people trying to shoot the basketball in the hoop to score points and to see who has more points at the end of 2 20 minute halfs. The two teams switch possession of the ball after every score and the two teams take turns trying to score on one another. The team that scored more points in the given time frame of 40 minutes is the team that wins. The are a few actions that players and teams can do during a game. Players can shot the ball at the basket attmepting to score, dribble the ball in an attempt to move around the court, pass the ball to other people on their team.

The way that teams score points in basketball is by shooting the basketball into the basket. There are many ways to score a basket but an important thing is how much a basket is worth. On the court there is a curved line with one existing on each half of the court. Shots/baskets that are made from inside this curved line are worth 2 points while shots that are made outside of the curved line are worth 3 points.

Another thing is that if a player is fouled when trying to score they are awarded free throws. This allows the player that got fouled a chance to shoot either 1, 2 or 3 free throws depending on shot and if it went in or not. The player stands behind a line know as the free throw line which is 15 feet from the hoop and is allowed to take 1, 2, or 3 shots at the hoop.

### Offensive Rating

To understand what is Offensive rating is in basketball it is important to understand what Per 100 Possession stats are since Offensive rating is build on per 100 possession stats.

First lets define what a possession is, a possession is every time a player does one of four things: attempts a field goal, misses a shot and does not get the offensive rebound, turns the ball over, and goes to the foul line for 2 or 3 free throws. Now basketball is a very unfair sport in the sense that there is 10 players on the court at a time and only one ball so some players are going to have more possessions with the ball than other players leading to them having more possessions and thus a better per possession statistical line as they have had more opportunities with the ball. To balance this out basketball statisticians have created something know as Per 100 Possession stats in which it looks at a players stats if they had 100 possessions. This creates a equal way to compare players as now every player has the same baseline.

Now that we have defined what Per 100 possession is lets define what offensive rating is and how it builds off of per 100 possession. Offensive rating is the number of points produced by a player per 100 total individual possessions. In other words it mean how many points would a player score in 100 possessions. To calculate this we find how many points a player produces divided by his total possessions then multiply by 100. This gets us offensive rating which uses per 100 possession stats to create a holistic statistical variable that allows us to judge a players overall offensive abilities compared to other players. The larger the number the more points they would score given 100 possessions.

Adjusted offensive rating is still offensive rating but since everyone players different levels of competition the skill level of the defense are not always equal. So adjusted offensive rating is the amount of points that the player would score on a league average defense given 100 possessions. \### Height in Basketball

Height is one of the most important physical attributes in basketball, it affects a player's ability to score, defend, and most importantly help their team win. Basketball favors taller players due to the height of the basket (10 feet) and the vertical nature of the sport. Height influences key aspects of basketball such as shooting, rebounding, and shot-blocking.

From an offensive perspective, taller players have a huge advantage near the basket since they can easily shoot over players and score easily with dunks and layups. They also can secure offensive rebounds and keep a possession alive, allowing for second-chance scoring opportunities. Defensively, taller players can easily contest shots and protect the rim, leading to more rebounds.

## Data Exploration and Descriptive Analysis

For our analysis, we have combined 2 data sets to make sure that we have all necessary values.

Our first data contains all players that have been drafted to the NBA between 2001 and 2021: <https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/history>. This data set contains important information like pick number and what college each player attended.

We combined that with the College Basketball 2009-2021 + NBA Advanced Stats data set: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021> which contains advanced offensive and defensive stats and important background information like the height of the players.

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Join CBB and draft data and fix height issue
cbb_join <- cbb %>% 
  left_join(select(nba, PLAYER, TEAM), by = c("player_name" = "PLAYER")) %>% 
  mutate(drafted = case_when(is.na(TEAM) ~ "No",
                             TRUE ~ "Yes")) %>%
  mutate(ht2 = ht) %>% 
  separate(ht2, sep = "-", into = c("ht_in", "ht_ft")) %>% 
  mutate(ht_ft = case_when(ht_ft == "May" ~ 5L,
                           ht_ft == "Jun" ~ 6L,
                           ht_ft == "Jul" ~ 7L,
                           TRUE ~ NA_integer_),
         ht_in = as.integer(ht_in),
         ht_total = ht_ft*12 + ht_in) %>% 
  mutate(ht_rev = case_when(ht == "Jun-00" ~ 72L,
                            TRUE ~ ht_total))
```

Let's begin by exploring the data. The data is stored in a dataset called `cbb_join` which is the fully joined `cbb` and `nba` data sets.

```{r head, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Print the (first 50 rows of) the data
head(cbb_join, 50)

# Get a summary of the data
summary(cbb_join)

```

```{r rows, echo=FALSE}
question("What does each row represent?",
  answer("Each teams college basketball stats"),
  answer("A college basketball player's stats for a given season", correct = TRUE, 
         message = "That's right! One row corresponds to one player's stats from one season. Most players have multiple rows in this data sets becuase most players compete for many seasons."),
  answer("A Player's career college Basketball Stats"),
  answer("A college basketball player's stats for a given game"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

Now that we now that each row represents a player's stats for one of their seasons, what does each column in the data set represent.

```{r q2, echo = FALSE}
question("What does `GP` represent",
  answer("The number of games a player played that year", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The number of shorts a player made that year"),
  answer("The number of games a player played in their whole NCAAB career"))

```

### Offensive Rating and Height Correlation

As we have already explained, offensive rating is how many points a player would score in 100 possessions. Now we are going to look at the linear relationship between height and adjusted offensive rating.

```{r graph}
cbb_join %>% 
  filter(Min_per > 5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ht_rev, y = adjoe)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlim(c(60, 90)) +
  labs(x = "height (inches)", y = "Adjusted Offensive Rating", title = "Height vs Adjusted Offensive Rating")

```

```{r q3, echo=FALSE}
question("What relationship does the linear regression show between height and offensive rating?",
  answer("negative and linear"),
  answer("positive and exponential"),
  answer("positive and linear", correct = TRUE, 
         message = "That's right! This graph shows a weak, positive, linear relationship between height and adjusted offensive rating."),
  answer("No relationship"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

As we can see in the graph, as the height of a player increases, so does their adjusted offensive rating in all NCAAB players.

## Berkson's Bias

Berkson's Bias is a type of selection bias that occurs when a study sample is not representative of a population due to variables the subjects are selected on. Berkson's Bias can lead to false negative correlations between different variables through selection one one or the other variable.

A clear example of Berkson's Bias is in actors. Actors are chosen based off a variety of actors, including their acting skill and attractiveness. If someone is very attractive or very good at acting they are likely to be selected and become a successful actor. If someone is very attractive and mediocre at acting, they will likely become an actor because their attractiveness makes up for their acting skills. Vice versa, if someone is a very good actor but is only moderately attractive they will likely become a successful actor because their acting skills outweigh their attractiveness.

This selection bias leads to a negative correlation in acting skills and attractiveness; however, this negative correlation is created by selection and is not representative of the population.

### Analyzing NBA Draftees using Linear Regression

Now we are going to examine the correlation between height and adjusted offensive rating between all NCAAB players and only those who were drafted to the NBA.

```{r }
# Create scatterplot of pairs of variables to see correlations
cbb_join %>% 
  filter(Min_per > 5) %>%
  # Remove comment from the line below to switch between only drafted players and all CBB
  ggplot(aes(x = ht_rev, y = adjoe)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  xlim(c(60, 90)) +
  facet_wrap(~ drafted) +
  labs(x = "Height (inches)", y = "Adjusted Offensive Rating", title = "Height vs Adjusted Offensive Rating Grouped by Draft Status")
  #ylim(c(0, 100))
```

The graph on the left contains all NCAA basketball players whether they were drafted or not while the graph on the right contains only NCAA basketball players that were drafted.

### Interpreting the Graph Results and Berkson's Bias

```{r}
 # Full CBB group
  summary(lm(data = filter(cbb_join, Min_per > 5), formula = adjoe ~ ht_rev))

  # Drafted group
  summary(lm(data = filter(cbb_join, Min_per > 5, drafted == "Yes"), formula = adjoe ~ ht_rev))

```

When performing our linear regression, we find that all NCAAB players had a least squares regression line of 74.71 + 0.28 (height in inches), which means that for every additional inch in height we are expected to see an increase of .28 in adjusted offensive rating.

When looking only at drafted players, our least squares regression line had an equation of 119.02915 - 0.03 (height in inches) which means that for every additional inch in height we saw a decrease in .03 in adjusted offensive rating.

This is a clear example of Berkson's Bias, as we observed a false negative relationship between height and adjusted offensive rating among drafted players. Our negative correlation does not mean that height leads to players being worse at offense, it simply means that when players are drafted they are selected on what they are good at. If a player is very tall and not as good at offense, they are much more likely to get drafted compared to someone with the same offensive skill that is shorter because height is a huge advantage in basketball.

When drafting players, front offices are willing to overlook lowered stats in one category for benefits in another category. Therefore, taller players can afford to have worse offensive skills because their height is such an advantage, but shorter players need to be good at offense otherwise they will not get drafted.

## Conclusion

One explanation on why there is Berkson's Bias for this data is because of how complicated the draft process is in the NBA. It is easier for taller players to score becuase they can easily score inside the paint and their shots aren't as contested. Therefore in the general population being taller should have a positive correlation with adjusted offensive rating. But when drafting NBA team front offices look at a lot more than just one statistical category.

One thing that NBA front offices look at is physical attributes as player with better physical attributes have a higher potential to be good players. This is because many NBA front offices have a very extensive training staff that can help these physically gifted athletes develop into good NBA players. Thus front offices are more open to overlooking college statistics if there is something else that could hint that the player would be good in the NBA. One of these things is height due to the nature of basketball and how being taller in basketball gives players an inherent advantage as the basket is in the air.

## Statistical Lesson

Berkson's Bias is an important factor to consider in data selection and analysis as it could show a linear correlation for a specific population be completely different to what is expected. This is important to keep in mind when doing statistical analysis as it can explain on why specific relationships exist and that a more general population could support the expected relationship.

Berkson's Bias is only one type of selection bias and when collecting data it's important to take into account if Berkson's Bias would effect the data and how to remove Berkson's Bias from the data collection. This will help with selecting data that is unbiased which is vital for data analysis.
